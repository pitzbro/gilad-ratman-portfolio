<h1>From the Bottom of the Earth to the Tip of the Cloud &nbsp;&ndash; and Back Again</h1>

<p>Gilad Ratman&rsquo;s latest work (
    <em>Swarm</em>, 2015) shows a flock of drones cruising endlessly and aimlessly inside a generic and undefined pristine-white
    structure. Presented as a five-screen video installation, each screen shows a steady frame of a different interior, some
    only a corridor, others with columns. These views are imbued with a flavor of utopian and modernist architecture. The
    scale is uncertain, as is the size of the drones. Only when we catch a glimpse of a human presence &ndash; the operators&rsquo;
    naked legs and torsos &ndash; do we gain an uncanny understanding that we are piping into a Lilliputian reality.</p>

<p>Although most of the views show these micro-drones swarming by, sometimes they are also seen falling, even &ldquo;humanly&rdquo;
    faltering and struggling to take flight. In some screens, the architectural setting where the drones are flying is being
    cut, already partially destroyed or subtly transformed on camera. The setting, we understand then, is made of styrofoam
    and is seen cut in slices by a hot wire. The wire itself is hardly seen, but its persistent &ldquo;hiss&rdquo; as opposed
    to the drone&rsquo;s &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; is heard, and a bit of smoke is occasionally seen rising before we see a whole
    section of the structure collapsing with a dry and muffled noise. The mere passing of the drones causes the pristine
    white interiors of modernist Corbusierian architecture to collapse.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bratton, an intellectual whose writings and lectures have a special influence on Ratman&rsquo;s works, would say
    that these &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; transform a place of modernism into a non-place; an unaccountable habitat.

</p>

<p>One of the most versatile and unmapped contemporary inventions, the drone is associated with an omnipresent eye, with control,
    with surveillance, and generally with the lack of privacy and the power of the &ldquo;&uuml;ber-state&rdquo; to control
    space. However, the drones Ratman shows in
    <em>Swarm</em> reverse this paradigm. We watch them. Nothing in the drones&rsquo; operation inspires feelings of exposure.
    Raman&rsquo;s use of drones comes rather to define space in the era after nation-state sovereignty that these machines
    represent.
</p>

<p>In fact, drone technological research and development embody the blurring of the private and the state, the civil and the
    military, high-tech (drones are complex machines&hellip;) and low-tech (&hellip;but any child can operate them). These
    days, while Amazon and other retailers are impatiently awaiting permits to deliver merchandise with drones, the military
    is readily executing suspects with them halfway around the globe; and while border patrols tightly monitor illegal immigration
    along the Mexico&ndash;US border, drugs are routinely flown and delivered by drug cartels across this same border with
    the same machines.</p>

<p>This multi-purpose characteristic of the drones is problematic as it permits the funneling of civilian budgets into the development
    of technology for military and paramilitary uses. Lately, the European organization
    <em>Statewatch</em> published a report exposing the fact that the EU has invested large amounts of tax money in corporate
    research for the development of drones:</p>

<p>
    <em>&euro;300 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money [was invested] in projects centered on or prominently featuring drone technology
        &hellip; [D]rones are being adapted for security purposes through research and development projects, all of which
        are dominated by European (and Israeli) defense multinationals seeking further diversification into &ldquo;civil&rdquo;
        markets. </em>[&hellip;]
    <em>The European Commission has long subsidized research, development and international cooperation among drone manufacturers.
        The European Defense Agency is sponsoring pan-European research and development for both military and civilian drones.
        The European Space Agency is funding and undertaking research into the satellites and communications infrastructure
        used to fly drones. Frontex, the EU&rsquo;s border agency, is keen to deploy surveillance drones along and beyond
        the EU&rsquo;s borders to hunt for migrants and refugees.</em>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Based largely on these conclusions, Jonas Staal makes a point in connecting drone research, development, and operation with
    the &ldquo;deep state&rdquo; and ultimately with ultranationalist movements, sweeping equally the supra-national technological
    &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; (Google, Facebook) on the one hand and the Middle Eastern deserts with ISIS and other groups on the
    other. As far-fetched as it might sound, Staal concludes, &ldquo;
    <em>[T]here is a direct relationship between ultranationalism and the EU&rsquo;s unaccountable investments into drone technology.
        For citizens to outsource their agency to the structures of the Deep State, they need to have the will to do so;
        the fears stoked by ultranationalism create this will&rdquo;.</em>

</p>

<p>Swarms have been an index of evil since the beginning of science fiction. Take the Star Wars films, for instance: a swarm
    of little spaceships&ndash; rather unorganized &ndash; cruising deep space is a gestalt that defines the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;
    &ndash; while the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; cruise more often in one big spaceship, cohesive and swiftly operating as an
    organized collective. The &ldquo;community-based&rdquo; aircraft is clearly opposed to the individually maneuvered vehicles
    of evil - &nbsp;an interstellar version of motorcycle gangs like the infamous and romanticized Hell Angels. Consider
    also the depiction of the disarray of Indians on horseback attacking a well-organized army battalion in the quintessential
    Western film, and even before that, the historical depiction of the &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; hordes conquering the Roman
    Empire. Finally, the West is still grappling with the growing consciousness that ISIS, that embodiment of popular culture&rsquo;s
    &ldquo;super-villain&rdquo;, is operating as a real army (and not as a chaotic horde, as it would fit better to their
    evil purpose) when it &ldquo;overruns large swaths of land in Iraq and Syria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This archetypical concept of swarms, both in nature and in history, reveals the deep sympathy our culture has for totalitarian
    systems, its dislike of the threat of individuality and disarray, and its misunderstanding of individual movements. But
    contemporary society and culture, shaped as they are by the technological dictatorship of Silicon Valley, might well
    be changing this perspective. In the end this conglomerate might welcome individuality as long as it is possible to cash
    in on its metadata. In any case, since technology can monitor and control unlimited numbers of individuals, they might
    not be viewed as a threat any longer, but rather as an enormous, succulent swarm.</p>

<p>This tension between the individual and the group is central to most of Gilad Ratman&rsquo;s works. The groups of individuals
    in his works, however, are as small as possible while still being able to behave in a transgressive, yet uniform way,
    as a nonverbal and nonhierarchical society from the forest rave in the night in
    <em>Alligatoriver</em>, through the cocooned figures in
    <em>Che Che the Gorgeous</em>, to the stoked individuals in
    <em>Multipillory</em> and the heads floating idly in the mud in the
    <em>588 Project</em>.&nbsp; The individuals composing Raman&rsquo;s small communities never communicate with each other.
    Each does its own thing &ndash; but all do the same. These proto-swarm communities live by a shared feeling of purpose
    that is created in the viewer rather than conveyed by the participants. This is the most salient feature of
    <em>The Workshop</em>, the 2013, five-screen video installation that follows a group of about 30 people through caves and
    tunnels and then in a sculpture and voice workshop that seems to have been improvised at the Israeli pavilion at the
    Giardini in Venice &ndash; the actual location where this work was exhibited.</p>

<p>Working on
    <em>Swarm</em>, Ratman researched the behavior of locusts, learning that the constant forward movement of these minute insects,
    familiar to us all, is indeed a race for food. But in fact, &ldquo;food&rdquo; is not the crops that the locusts devastate
    in their wake, but a race to eat the locust in front while escaping the one coming form behind. Locusts advance the way
    they do because they are fleeing imminent cannibalism.
    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>
</p>

<p>This ambiguity implicit in frantic and constant movement in swarms informs the movement of the micro-drones in
    <em>Swarm</em>. In fact, one possibility that is intuitively overruled is that the drones are battling each other, pursuing
    and chasing as the locusts do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>Do the crimes of the drone army result in the collapse of the structure? Not necessarily, for in Ratman&rsquo;s works there
    is never a causality between the different actions we see, and above all there is no reason whatsoever why we, as spectators,
    can be aware of what is happening on the screen.</p>

<p>Examples of this ubiquitous condition are found in all of Ratman&rsquo;s works: in
    <em>Multipillory</em>, nothing tells us how these individuals ended up in such a dire situation. Nowhere in
    <em>The Workshop</em> can we discern a logical thread or outcome. In the
    <em>588 Project</em>, there is no point in asking what these people are doing immersed in mud from their heads down or why
    they seem to be content in that existential situation. Similarly, the drones in
    <em>Swarm</em> do not give a reason for their frantic comings and goings, aside from movement itself. Nothing is achieved.
    There is never a conclusion to the situation created. This seems puzzling, as it deprives us viewers from the benefit
    of a narrative shaped by linearity and causality.</p>

<p>There is always something &ldquo;basic&rdquo; in Ratman&rsquo;s works: an archaic look stressed by the participant&rsquo;s
    sloppy, &ldquo;hippy&rdquo; outfits, the lack of speech that endows his works with a primitive aura.
    <em>Swarm</em> is his first work unequivocally placed in the present &ndash; or, we could say, even in the future. However,
    as we saw before, the meanings and interests that shape Ratman&rsquo;s works lie in a contemporary reading of society
    and in the philosophical implications of the technological revolutions we are experiencing without being aware of all
    their consequences.</p>

<p>The arbitrariness of Raman&rsquo;s plots, then, has to be interpreted in the light of technological developments that do
    not seek to cater to specific needs; on the contrary, the needs are created in the wake of technological development.
    The best example of this is so-called social media. Was Facebook the missing tool for human connectivity? Hardly, but
    there is no doubt that this tool is shaping the world we live in, and today it is impossible to envision a society operating
    without it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world is driven by technological developments that appear to have a commercial potential, however obscure, over actual
    user benefit. Edward Snowden&rsquo;s declarations about NSA operations show just how far governments go to collect data
    on millions of citizens, even knowing they pose no threat to its security, just &ldquo;because it can&rdquo;, for no
    reason and for no purpose. For the time being, this is a good example of how inconsequentiality drives our world.</p>

<p>Another conspicuous aspect of Ratman&rsquo;s works that relates to the technological realms of the Contemporary is his recurrent
    dealing with connectivity issues as found in systems designed by social media, the Internet in general, and lately by
    the ideas of the Cloud and the Stack. This is manifest in his works with sound cables (
    <em>The Workshop </em>and
    <em>5 Bands</em>), with transparent tubes (
    <em>588 Project</em>), and with tunnels that undermine national borders (in
    <em>The Workshop). </em>Interestingly, in
    <em>Swarm</em>, Ratman took care to show the drone operators holding the remote controls. Indeed, the wireless connection
    here has a function similar to that of the closed information-flow systems in his other works.</p>

<p>From this perspective, we should not see Ratman&rsquo;s new work as a break with the dichotomy between the element &ldquo;earth&rdquo;
    (mud, tunnels) and the element &ldquo;air&rdquo; (breathing tubes, microphones, sound cables, etc.), but rather an integration
    relating, again, to Benjamin Bratton&rsquo;s view of the &nbsp;&ldquo;
    <em>master architecture of the space of the geo-political, an organizing structure of the world-order/ Earth-order, a generative
        partition of the domains of space according to which subdivisions of sovereignty are constituted and enforced: from
        arbitrary territorial capture, to technique of delineation, to geopolitical order (because derived from the earth,
        geo), to the language of cosmogram/ world-map, and back again</em>&rdquo;. Further on, quoting Frederick Jameson,
    Bratton pinpoints the problem precisely in terms that closely reflect Ratman&rsquo;s interest: &ldquo;
    <em>Yet the prophecy of an air-power return to total war,</em>&rdquo; writes Bratton after Jameson, &ldquo;
    <em>with the friend-foe pairing replaced by self and other, human and subhuman, is only partially correct, for it is no longer
        a question of air as an element, but one of cyberspace. Information is the new element that reproblematizes the spatia</em>l.&rdquo;
    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>Whether with buried sound devices, with individuals walking and crawling under the earth, or with drones flying in limited
    spaces, Raman&rsquo;s works should always be seen as questioning the conventional definitions of space and territory
    by digging into the basis of contemporary cultural changes that we may only tangentially know of, but that shape dramatically
    our every day life.</p>
