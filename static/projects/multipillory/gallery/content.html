</p>
<p>On subcultures, noise, and theatricality in the work of Gilad Ratman</p>
<p>Martha Kirszenbaum</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noise accompanies every manifestation of our life. Noise is familiar to us. Noise has the power to bring us back to
    life. On the other hand, sound, foreign to life, always a musical, outside thing, an occasional element, has come to
    strike our ears no more than an overly familiar face does our eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luigi Russolo,
    <em>The Art of Noises</em>, 1913</p>


<p>In the summer of 1994, my parents suggested that I attend a summer camp in Mazury, the stunning lake region of northern Poland.
    My fellow campers were youngsters from Warsaw, brilliant minds and dark souls, most of whom were dressed in black and
    dark green with military boots, along with a heavy metal soundtrack. Some older kids had brought cassettes and we decided
    to black out the main reception room of the large house situated in the middle of the Polish countryside. We danced all
    day to Polish metal music instead of going out swimming. One of my friends told me with a vibrant excitement about a
    mythical metal music festival in Poland named
    <em>Jarocin</em> that had just been suspended the same year after clashes with the police. I was a teenager born and raised
    outside of Paris, and I had no idea that his story was relevant to a larger Eastern-European subculture movement in the
    1990s that conveyed the legacy of punk and metal at a very specific moment in Polish history. Just after the fall of
    the Berlin wall and right before the explosion of neo-liberalism &ndash; these were a couple of years that seemed like
    a sparkle of freedom and utopia for Polish youth.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Subcultures </strong>
</p>

<p>For one of his video works presented at TRAFO in Szczecin and entitled
    <em>Five Bands from Romania</em>&nbsp;(2011-2015), Gilad Ratman traveled to Romania to film five heavy metal bands in an
    empty field in the countryside near Bucharest. There the musicians buried their amplifiers and performed an experimental
    one-track play composed of distorted vocals, drums and guitar sounds. In the conception of this work, Ratman has been
    influenced by two seminal rock concerts in the history of popular culture: Pink Floyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Live at Pompei&rdquo;
    from 1971 and Metallica&rsquo;s live performance in Moscow in 1991, attended by over a million spectators including soldiers
    from the Red Army.&nbsp; Inversely,
    <em>Five Bands</em> explores the heavy metal subculture and how it reflected the political opposition in Eastern Europe at
    the beginning of the 1990&rsquo;s, not the importation of American acts to the former Eastern Bloc. The connection between
    heavy metal and the fall of Soviet Union was the result of the construction of a subversive, controversial and anarchic
    counter-culture developed within the communist regime for almost two decades. The cohesion that links the protagonist
    of this
    <em>docufiction</em> is definitely that of an underground community which Ratman was able to subtlety penetrate and depict
    thanks to a very agile camera edit.&nbsp; It is precisely the tension between documentary and fiction that seems at stake
    in Ratman&rsquo;s film practice and which fills
    <em>Five Room</em> with a paradoxical impression of immediacy and distance. In using various manipulations and re-articulation
    of video and sound, he reveals the shortcomings and advantages of the cinematographic medium.</p>

<p>Although it was filmed in Romania, the two-channel work immediately echoes the subculture of punk and metal in Poland in
    the 1980s and 1990s. Defined as a controversial libertarian movement, its popularity only grew in the 1990s. The adherents
    and fans of heavy metal rock were known in Poland as
    <em>Metalowcy</em>. They were recognizable by their long hair and standard wardrobe of tight jeans or leather attire adorned
    with badges or inscriptions of their favorite bands. The music's raw volume was like that of punk rock; heavy metal was
    more rhythmic and technical compared to the raw straightforward sound of the former. Major bands in the Polish heavy
    metal circuit were TSA, Turbo, and Kat and it was their cassettes that my camp-mates would listen to all day long.
    <em>Five Bands from Romania</em> immediately reminded me of this summer and particularly of
    <em>Jarocin</em>, the most noticeable music festival in Europe and certainly the largest in the Soviet Bloc, which was taking
    place in the central Polish town of Jarocin. Founded in 1980 and organized annually throughout two decades, it became
    a legend on its own. Thousands of youths would flock to the provincial town, live in tents for a few days and enjoy the
    music of bands that otherwise barely got any radio time or other possibilities to present themselves. It represented
    an ongoing oasis of freedom in the communist realm.</p>

<p>Cultural historian Deena Weinstein argues that heavy metal has persisted far longer than most genres of rock music due to
    the growth of an intense subculture which identified directly with the music. Metal fans formed an &ldquo;exclusionary
    youth community&rdquo; which was "distinctive and marginalized from the mainstream&rdquo; society.</p>


<p>
    <strong>Liquid community </strong>
</p>

<p>Gilad Ratman appears to be dealing in his work with the notion of community. He indeed films Romanian heavy metal musicians
    in
    <em>Five Bands From Romania</em>, and groups of people enjoying sinking into mud pools in
    <em>588 Project</em>, a video that was actually shot in a studio in Arkansas that specializes in the production of &ldquo;mud
    submersion&rdquo; films
    <em>.</em> In previous interviews Ratman refers to the idea of temporary communities as &ldquo;air bubbles&rdquo; within
    the digesting apparatus of globalization and capitalism since they prevent us from noticing the hidden mechanisms that
    control us. Ratman emphasizes the role of social motivation in bringing together a group of people in a certain situation,
    for instance, a community of artists.</p>

<p>In fact, he always travels and shoots with a group of friends or collaborators rather than professional actors. In this way
    he recreates, forges and depicts communities, including his own. Community in his projects appears as a rampart against
    what Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman has coined &ldquo;liquid modernity&rdquo;. This term defines a post-modern society
    marked by the global capitalist economies with their increasing privatization of services and by the information revolution,
    in which the absolute freedom of markets provoke the loss of ground, attachment, and solidarity for human bodies. Uncertainty
    has been transformed into generalized fear and humiliation has replaced exploitation. The liquid gap and the tension
    between the individual and the society can be solidified possibly by the social link found in communities, groups of
    people who share a common ensemble of ideas, values and experiences.</p>

<p>The metaphor of liquidity and the living matter of human relations can be extended when analyzing
    <em>588 Project</em>&nbsp;(2009), a meditative split-screen video work depicting an earthly and bubbly scene of characters
    immersed in and slowly emerging from a lake of muddy water.&nbsp; Beyond the heavy sound of breathing or the &lsquo;music&rsquo;
    of the flutes, what strikes the viewer is the particular role played by mud, a matter with a deeply physical aspect related
    to Greek mythology in which the god Prometheus shapes man out of clay. The chaotic and anamorphous presence of the mud
    provides a highly sensual, surrealistic and fetishistic feeling of out-of-space, emphasized in this work by the role
    of sound and noise.</p>


<p>
    <strong>The rest is noise</strong>
</p>

<p>Gilad Ratman&rsquo;s video practice denotes a particular attention to the treatment of sound and noise. Most of his works
    contain a specific soundtrack, composed of naturally recorded music, electrical distortions, compression of sounds, and
    modulated frequencies. Whether he uses the strangled sound of the buried amplifiers of Eastern-European metal bands as
    in
    <em>Five Bands from Romania</em>; the obsessive, buzzing noise of miniatures drones in
    <em>Swarm</em> (2015), or the enchanted soft and dissonant swish created by muddy waters dripping off wooden flutes in
    <em>588 Project</em>, Ratman seems to construct the image through the sound that becomes a fundamental component of most
    of his works.</p>

<p>In his 1913 Futurist Manifesto entitled
    <em>The Art of Noise</em>, Italian painter and composer Luigi Russolo argued that the human ear has become accustomed to
    the speed, energy, and noise of the urban industrial soundscape; furthermore, this new sonic palette requires a new approach
    to musical instrumentation and composition. He proposes a number of conclusions about how electronics and other technology
    will allow futurist musicians to "substitute for the limited variety of timbres that the orchestra possesses today the
    infinite variety of timbres in noises, reproduced with appropriate mechanisms". Gilad Ratman&rsquo;s treatment of his
    soundtracks in all of the films presented at TRAFO (
    <em>Five Bands from Romania</em>,
    <em>Swarm</em>,
    <em>588 Project</em>&nbsp;and
    <em> Multipillory</em>) interestingly echoes the classification made by Russolo who defined six types of noise: roars; whistling;
    whispers; screeching; noises obtained by beating on objects; and voices of animals and people such as shouts and screams.
    The crucial signification of voices and silence also leads us to reflect on the theatricality of Ratman&rsquo;s practice.</p>


<p>
    <strong>Polish Theater</strong>
</p>

<p>Based on a classical medieval instrument of humiliation and torture &ndash; the pillory &ndash;
    <em>Multipillory</em>&nbsp;(2010) is a loop projected onto a wooden freestanding structure that was once used for a grotesque
    performance filmed and re-projected onto the same structure. On the front of the structure that also acts as a projecting
    wall, we see the heads of the characters trapped in cutout holes. When the camera turns around the structure, we discover
    that their bodies are trapped in difficult, if not ridiculous, unnatural body positions. Recalling a tableau vivant,
    the figures stand still; some of them are naked, some wear underwear. The tautological process of projecting an image
    of an object onto the very same object only adds to the
    <em>d&eacute;calage</em> between reality and representation. The desperate and humorous absurdity of this unfinished scene
    evokes the theatrical work of Tadeusz Kantor, a major figure of post-war Polish art &ndash; a painter, theater director,
    poet, actor and happening performer close to Dadaism. Kantor&rsquo;s post-dramatic theatrical events included an illustration
    of the memory mechanism through a succession of unreal images, crumbs of remembrances, obsessive scenes and absurd situations,
    which transformed characters and objects according to his imagination. His groundbreaking performance from 1975 &ldquo;The
    Dead Class&rdquo; staged a group of haunted and apparently useless characters, most of which were in fact played by mannequins
    as real-life actors and incorporating many elements taken from Polish-Jewish culture. The stillness of the characters
    in Ratman&rsquo;s
    <em>Multipillory</em>&nbsp;recalls the mannequins and possibly also the particular significance of puppet theater in Polish
    culture and in the history of Polish theater in general. The presence of the human bodies represented as mannequins also
    reminded me of the writings of Bruno Schulz, an avant-garde Polish Jewish writer and artist from the 1930s and 1940s.
    Influenced by Franz Kafka, he often combined surrealist humor with realistic details, thus embodying his work with an
    incisive sense of everyday life. Shot in the head by a Nazi officer in the ghetto of Drohobycz in 1942, he left behind
    dozens of brilliant drawings and short fictions such as
    <em>The</em>
    <em>Cinnamon Shops</em>, published in 1934 (called
    <em>The Street of Crocodiles </em>in English) and his best-known short story,
    <em>Sanatorium Under the Hourglass</em>, published in 1937. Schulz was fascinated by matter, dead or alive, and by its fluidity.
    Key characters in his writings are mannequins and dummies which represent a spirit alienated by the body, a subject that
    has become an object. They symbolize the decadence of modernity with its cheap boutiques and wax dummies presented in
    window displays.</p>

<p>This fundamental role of fluid matter, an extended sense of humor and a certain alternative to modernity is the link to Gilad
    Ratman&rsquo;s film practice. &ldquo;The matter never jokes", writes Bruno Schultz, "it is always filled with a tragic
    sense of seriousness.&rdquo;</p>
