<p>I am the buryman of Gilad Ratman.</p>
<p>His scars, his diseases, they do me no harm. I don't judge him. I don't judge his lifestyle. I don&rsquo;t judge his hygiene
    level, the carbonization of lungs, his cholesterol, the quality of his sperm, his sight and hearing, if they are good
    enough, if he developed them, if he neglected them, his intellectual abilities, what he did about them, whether he did
    his best or not - it's all fine by me. Whatever he is, I welcome him. I am well prepared. When the time comes, there
    will be no reason for me to linger. I will have my place chosen and get to work promptly. I will know exactly what to
    do. All the sequences and functionalities are set &ndash; they have been considered and reconsidered, theorized and checked,
    imagined and investigated. Step by step, each of his organs, every single bit of his tissue, all his muscles and veins,
    his hair and blood, nails and aliment leftovers, they will all get dismembered, dissected, adjusted, conformed and finally,
    transplanted. That, I will do myself.</p>
<p>In doing my job I learned to take my time and be patient. I never accept last minute calls.
    I earned my position to know the client long before he dies. I like it that way. I like to know who I am working
    with. And I like to know his rhythms - how he moves, if he is relaxed or stiff, how he dances, how he sings, what he
    eats for breakfast, if he smokes before going to bed, everything. With Gilad Ratman, I like the way he speaks. His speech
    is immediate and he seems to know where he wants to go. He doesn't waste time - while speaking, I mean. He delivers.
    He triggers off, he points and shoots. He is a man of trajectories,
    <em>a priori</em> trajectories. You need to know these things well to speak like he does. I like that. I like that a lot.
    I thought of it several times, I made my evaluations, and now I am ready to state it clearly: he is the one to complete
    my arrangement.</p>
<p>I don't think of my job as easy. Since I know it well I rarely make mistakes, but I still have to be cautious and watchful.
    I need discipline. I don&rsquo;t take more than a dozen of cases per year. Some of us, they take more than that, but
    I consider it fraud. There are some numerical limitations to all logistics I think. At a certain level you just can&rsquo;t
    keep the quality of your service. After all, we're not waste managers, we don't just distribute bodies, and this is not
    about squeezing anything or trying to make the ground fertile. Also, do not mistake me for a gravedigger. I don't do
    surface ceremonies. I don't cover anything. And I don't like people to watch me working. They always get emotional, they
    murmur and cry and if they are unsatisfied they tend to get aggressive. It&rsquo;s useless and annoying. Once the funeral
    is over and they leave I have all the time in the world. This moment is a thrill. It is me, the newcomer, and my past
    - my decisions, the spaces I have created, the niches and the boulevards, the squares, the plains and roofs and ponds,
    the trees, the trees of various leaves and impossible shapes, a few deserts, countless balconies in providently counted
    houses, the ropes and the twirling roundabouts, chairs, graffiti or whatever you want to call it &ndash; maybe books,
    if you will - then my past lovers and my long time enemies, all of them dismantled, dissolved, disintegrated but not
    disappeared - in a constant process of being devoured by this ubiquitous air of mine: the earth. Crust, small blocks,
    scabs, clods, calluses, holdups, nuggets, big blocks, stones and mud, tiny pieces of various rocks, sands, clay, medium
    size blocks. Then, I have the black maple leaves, I have the black peonies and I have the black eustomas.</p>
<p>I never complain about my job. It is what it is. My dyspnoea is not as annoying as it used to be. It is true however that
    there is very little air here.
    However, if you are dependent on something like that, you have to count on the corpses' cavities. There's always something
        to inhale in there. Apart from that, there is no real reliable oxygen provider. But air is a mundane phenomenon,
    I'm telling you. It&rsquo;s overrated. And it only brings the illusion of openness. If I may suggest, you too should
    be careful about that. The concept is misleading because in the end it's wiser to replace air with connections and loops.
    All you need is a simple arrangement, nicely designed, which sets everything to work. See, the space I run might be limited,
    but it is not empty. It is tight and very, very slow. With each movement, I have to press and push. Imagine swimming
    in mud or trying to float in the air. That's effort. I mean - that's real effort. That&rsquo;s why when I start my dissection
    I am always sure of my aims. I like to be elegant. I respect the corpse and I don't like wasting my energy. I calculate
    my locomotion. That&rsquo;s why I stopped touching myself. It isn't that necessary. Once air is replaced with earth,
    I am fully satisfied with touching dead people. After all, there are two ways to serve them right. One is to punish them.
    The other is to give them what they asked for, to follow their instructions, and maybe push a bit. Both of the ways are
    neutral. Irony is normally beyond my control but if somebody asked for it, he would surely get it. My efficiency in both
    is even, but I shall always be aware of taking a stand. In this case I already made my decision long time ago: I am not
    going to act against Gilad Ratman.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>I used to appreciate air. And I like life, I&rsquo;ve always had a light heart for it. Clearly, it is not a very popular
    approach in my domain and I&rsquo;ve became known for my deviation. In fact, I decided to make it a statement. A program.
    A method. I used to keep the bodies tight and in one piece for as long as I could. I did all the internal preparations
    through the skin - swapping the testicles with the brain, ordering the lungs, heart and spleen vertically, one above
    another, pulling the thyroid down to meet the mouth of the arse, all these things which you can do without opening the
    body. With each new corpse I also used to reconfigure the external settings, the milieu of the new body which is always
    made of countless livers, anuses, fingers, eyeballs and knees, tongues, noses, brains, vulvas, spleens, intestines and
    veins, veins and veins, endless veins which are essential to my work. I have to foresee their potential shapes &ndash;
    it&rsquo;s something I always have to do. It's a matter of honesty, of doing a proper job. Then I drive all the vessels
    and tubes, readjust all the possible links and order them around the newcomer, choose his main aorta and reduce the leaks
    inside the body. When this is done, the veins of the fresh corpse call for ties. I do the knots slowly and gently - everything
    through the oral cavity - and pull the aorta out of the mouth. Then, and only then, all is ready for me to proceed with
    the main operation: in an instant, with a single, slender choreography of my uneven hands, I cut the corpse's aorta with
    the right and in that very same millisecond plug a carefully chosen external aorta awaiting in my left hand. Simple.
    Effective. Gallant. I became known for this method and until now there is nobody who loses less of a corpse's inner air
    than myself.</p>
<p>My masterpiece was Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinetti. He was a troublemaker. I had never seen such thing before. A long time
    after arrival his body was still active. At first, he had a long phase of Lazarus signs &ndash; but recurrent! Then his
    heart started to work. Irregularly, pumping only from time to time and no longer than for a few beats. Then again. A
    substantial break. And again. An even longer break. And once more. But then at some point, some time ago, in between
    one heart attack and another, when I was already busy with someone else, I can't remember who it was exactly, suddenly
    came the words, the words of Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinetti, vomited from his larynx. I can't hear well, of course,
    but I could easily make out: WE ARE NOT OUT OF BREATH. And later: OUR HEART IS NOT IN LEAST TIRED. And then: THIS IS
    BECAUSE YOU DO NOT EVEN REMEMBER HAVING LIVED. His very own words, quoted by himself. There and then, within this world
    filled with the black, dark and pressing substance of no-air, un-air, in a space of mute bodies and no feedback, he uttered
    his own manifesto word by word. It is not easy to scare me but this was indeed impressive. Not really because it felt
    improbable, no, or perhaps not only because of that. Quite the contrary - it threatened me because he proved - Filippo
    Tomasso Emilio Marinetti himself proved - that I might have been right all this time. And he also proved that
    <em>he</em> might have been right: there is life, there is always life. He was not out of breath. He will never be out of
    breath. Our hearts are not in least tired. If not alive - what could he possibly be?</p>
<p>My entire method derives after him. I learned that the
    <em>systema respiratorium</em> of each and every single corpse should keep its integrity. This is where the air comes from,
    this is where breathing is born, a blow, a sudden gust of wind from our earthly lives and if only we could keep these
    cavities, if only we could save some air, if only there would be one Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinetti every now and then,
    if only I could perform my dismembering with no loss of air, if only I could do my job right, if only I could connect
    everything properly, then I would indeed succeed, I would succeed with pumping the air, I would succeed with keeping
    it in circulation and I would succeed with providing to all my furthest provinces the life-giving nothingness of air.
    The thing is that I don't. I lived my hope for a long enough time now. I tried and I did my best. I was militant and
    concentrated. I don't recall a single mistake, except maybe trusting that there will be more Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinettis,
    that there will always be a gigantic air producer, a body-volcano erupting with air, that there will be more of those
    body-factories to produce air. But there are no factories and there is no air-industry.</p>
<p>Some say Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinetti was a man of industry. Cars, airplanes, cities, tanks and steel, bombs and trains,
    infrastructures, heaviness, efficiency, outcome. But that's one of the advantages of my job - I get the real perspective,
    undistorted by everyday fascinations, clearer, bereft of all the historical incidentals. Trust me: Filippo Tomasso Emilio
    Marinetti was not the man of industry. He was the man of air. Everything that ever happened to him - it all happened
    in air, the void of freedom, where everything can be articulated freely. Bombs falling over Monte Cucco, book deliveries,
    bullets drifting randomly in space, trains yelling from iron bridges, large letters simultaneously sounding, even words
    on paper: they needed empty space in his books. He was a man of air and hence he was a man of sound. Everything - to
    keep up his standards of vitality - must have sounded, resounded, reverberated, bounced and rattled like phenomena in
    empty spaces reflecting themselves. Life is freedom, freedom is emptiness and emptiness is air. Lively metaphors, life-giving
    energy, indeterminate lives,
    <em>Parole in Libert&agrave;</em>... a century of life, which of course, meant a century of freedom. But freedom means nothing
    except air, which of course, is sound. Free sound. Unearthed sound. Sound as sound; all up there, un-pin-downnable, un-nailable,
    all just drifting indeterminately around us, like flies in empty zoos, like dust in a vacuum, like oxygen in air, mesmerizing,
    just mesmerizing, then the oxygen expands in your brain, you are thinking quicker, you are making associations faster,
    the pressure is rising, everything is connecting, you are seeing, your blood is boiling, you are thinking and you yourself,
    your very own oxygen, you yourself are bursting out of your brain through your ears. It just does not work. Full stop.
    There is no airy life underground. I did believe the contrary though. I believed it for a long, long time. I did my best.
    I had different people coming: random people and others whom I chose myself. I had opera divas and bingo players. There
    were soldiers and porn stars. I had composers. I had electronic musicians. All different sorts of potential Filippo Tomasso
    Emilio Marinettis, I thought - and yet none of them got me what I wanted.</p>
<p>So let me make it clear: in my domain it was only him, it was only Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinetti, and then nothing for
    long, long years. Nothing. Until now.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>When Gilad Ratman comes along, I will do the contrary. I will start with the scalp. I will open his body slowly and irreversibly
    and then let everything go. The air will go. The liver will fall to the side. The lungs will shimmy down. The veins will
    disseminate randomly.</p>
<p>I intend to do everything with one cut. Again: the left hand will proceed with the knife, the right one will take the skin
    off. It will take whole lot of precision, softness, and decisiveness, but I am not afraid. I know what to do. And there
    is no rush. The air will be released as the ubiquitous soil absorbs it (although in my humble opinion it would be fair
    to say it will devour it). This tiny battle will take me off, I know it. I am the acting general there. And as it is
    still happening, as his body is being squeezed into the ground, getting sloppy, the sticky organs getting sprinkled with
    soil crust, the viscous liver falling to the left, the spleen getting stuck and me... and me there, doing my performance
    and not only that, doing my performance and succeeding, doing my performance and being aware from the very beginning
    that I will succeed, and all that with my hands immersed deep down in his guts, floating in between his kidneys and bumping
    into his spine, seeking his hollow parts, cavities, spaces uncolonized by the earth...&nbsp; then I will know that is
    what I want. That's exactly what I want this time. I will be waiting for the moment when all the blood and all the sperm
    and all the liquids will be absorbed by the earth. I want his body hollow, drained of all content. For some time probably
    only air will inhabit his holes, there will be bladders and blisters in the body of Gilad Ratman but that does not worry
    me too much. Air is easy. It is always ready to receive earth. Once that moment is reached, once I make sure there is
    no blood and no sperm and no bile and no saliva and no digestives - I will start.</p>
<p>First, I will find his sperm duct and pluck it out. My hand versus his
    <em>vas deferens</em>. My hand fisting his sperm duct, but without aggression, no hard feelings, no anger - only trying not
    to unnecessarily tear anything apart. I will move his prostate a bit, just a tiny bit, with my little finger. I will
    barely do anything, but just enough to make sure that the prostate gets in the mouth of the sperm duct, that it stretches
    the mouth slightly and remains there, tight. Then &ndash; the voice strings. This is an easy thing to do. I just need
    to be delicate. I will cut them swiftly, hold them both in my right hand, separate them from the larynx, close them in
    the palm of my hand and then neatly hang them more or less in the middle of the sperm duct. Once this is done I will
    hold his sperm duct in my right hand on the side of the prostate so I can precisely feel its tensions as I begin to seek
    the liver with my left hand. Not
    <em>his</em> liver, of course. I will have one prepared. My left hand will follow my directions easily, since I know where
    it is and who it belongs to. It is Plato. "Hearing is the effect of a stroke which is transmitted through the ears by
    means of the air, brain, and blood to the soul, beginning at the head and extending to the liver". In my kingdom , I
    decided for the reverse. With the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries replaced by the sperm duct taken from Gilad
    Ratman, I will make everything spout out of Plato's liver - I will make the stroke spout out from there.</p>
<p>To do that, I will need to proceed with the distribution system. It will be the longest phase of my work. I will need to
    isolate all the tubes. A terrible process in the beginning but it teaches you patience.
    <em>Vena cava superior, vena cava inferior, vena azygos, vena portae, ven iugularis interna, vena iugularis externa</em>
    &hellip;a mantra... thousands of meters and then more of them, and even more and endless more and more and more. But I will
    need to search out all of them. Everything. Every single vein I can find. I will not be satisfied with anything under
    10 kilometers of hollow tubes (excluding of course 30 centimeters of duct). Logistically, a horror. I need to find them
    all, cut and splice, separate, put away, order and ensure that they don't get lost. I have a system for storage of these
    veins. I form letters with them. I already have more or less 850,000 kilometers collected and they all go in lines, each
    line in different direction, and they go around and almost reach the again point from which they begin. The structure
    is the following: each vein leads to another one which forms a letter, and each letter leads to another one which forms
    a word, and each word leads to another one which forms a passage and then at some point, as you probably know now, I
    can write entire books with hollow
    <em>venae</em>. With Gilad Ratman&rsquo;s I decided to quote Filippo Tomasso Emilio Marinetti and Marsilio Ficino respectively:
    "I confess that before so intoxicating a spectacle we strong Futurists have felt ourselves suddenly detached from women,
    who have suddenly become too earthly, or, to express it better, have become a symbol of the earth that we ought to abandon"
    and right under it "The sky is married to the earth but does not touch it. He does not copulate with his wife, the earth,
    but he beholds his wife through the pits of the stars, as if with the rays of eyes that are everywhere, and beholding
    her, he impregnates her and creates living things. Now does not one who bestows life just by looking have a certain life
    of his own?"</p>
<p>When these phrases are done, when all is cut, separated and organized in words, when my text is written and with some level
    of dedication is made available to this blind reader who follows the bends of the veins, a sort of reader-traveler who
    goes into circles searching for prose, once this is all done, I can see into the next phase: the
    <em>bronchi</em>. I decided to use my very favorite ones - the
    <em>bronchi</em> of Marsilio Ficino. This is not an ordinary organ. I kept it well preserved. I did my very best because
    with all due respect to his statements, life is infinite, yes - but only if you take proper care of it. I liked to prove
    him right. I liked to see the circulation, his own life-giving circulation after its own prophet's death. He needed me
    to complete his argument. Otherwise, if I didn&rsquo;t do my job well, everything would just become stuck, rotten, and
    then dissolve into the ground, and there would be no life after death. His
    <em>bronchi </em>are crucial here: an unusual example of internal painting. I rarely have this feeling of regret but when
    I touch them, I almost feel pity for myself for being blind. They are not oval at all and they are not a pair. They are
    quadrupled and they are triangles. If Plato's liver is the center of my arrangement, then the
    <em>bronchi</em> of Marsilio Ficino is its systematic structure - a framework, a square. If Plato's liver is its amplifier
    and all the vessels are cables, then
    <em>bronchi</em> of Marsilio Ficino are the fine plug-ins. They connect and they refine. They are the spirit, they are the
    sound: "Musical sound by the movement of the air moves the body: by purified air it excites the aerial spirit which is
    the bond of body and soul: by emotion it affects the senses, and at the same time the soul: by meaning it works on the
    mind: finally, by the very movement of the subtle air it penetrates strongly: by its contemperation it flows smoothly:
    by the conformity of its quality it floods us with a wonderful pleasure: by its nature, both spiritual and material,
    it at once seizes, and claims as its own, man in his entirety".
    <em>Bronchi</em>, The Spirit.
    <em>Bronchi</em>, The Plug-Ins. In between the body and the soul - but at the same time inside of the body.
    <em>Bronchi,</em> The Stars, in between the sky and the earth - yet fully underground. They do that penetration, the circular
    exchange between air and earth, inside of earth, as the earth gets swallowed by hollow tubes and the air gets devoured
    by the striving earth. This is the perfect circulation: the circulation of the earth, the new air. I was waiting for
    that to happen. I was waiting with the
    <em>bronchi </em>of Marsilio Ficino in my hands &ndash; I wanted to do him justice.</p>
<p>Then, I will need a bunch of adapters. Cocks. Hard bones, hollow, perforated - namely: flutes. I have plenty of them. They're
    everywhere I move. Ancient flutes. Short and long, thick and thin, straight and slightly curved, dark and very dark,
    sleazy and majestic, modest and efficient - I bump into them constantly, looking for veins or livers, and every now and
    then I end up with a cock in my hand, which I don't like so much to be totally honest - it reminds me of touching myself
    (old story). But none of them in my collection come from the human species. They usually just go under "beef". But that's
    alright. They serve men, even if the ghostly speech machines will never play. They are the cocks and they are the voices
    of the deceased at the same time. They are echoes born out of speech. They are potency stemming from disturbed air. They
    are circulation turning sound into sperm. They are the mirrors of an empty sperm duct. They enclose the system by opening
    the vessels to the soil. I will stick them into the tiny islands of the
    <em>bronchi</em> of Marsilio Ficino, one flute per island, and I will have hundreds of them, this is a must. Each small part
    of
    <em>bronchi</em> must have its own flute so that the earth gets easily inside of the system. And then keeping the flutes
    in my right hand, flute after flute, I will stick each one of them into another mouth taken from my immense collection.
    I will use some mute-mouths like Albert Berg and Ronaldo Martinez and even more from the selection of the wonderful Colette
    Novani and Olivia di Francesco - a tamped mouth gallery I will have - and then I will choose one mouth, the mouth of
    Wolfgang Franciscus de Paula Johannes Elemosinarius von Kempelen, and together with his tongue I will stretch it with
    my left hand and I then will install the eardrum inside them with my right hand and then for the grande finale, I will
    tamp the eardrum mouth onto the sperm duct of Gilad Ratman.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>Some way down near the bottom of San Andreas Fault, this is where it is, the place where two tectonic plates meet, a long
    and deep scar you may still find somewhere on your way through California. They do the slip: a heavy, continuous and
    low clash, the driver of my system, the primal sound of the voice itself. The earth itself. My arrangement is not underground;
    it is not in the ground or inside the ground. It is the ground. In my infinite room, there will be no place for failure,
    no place for air, there will be no more metaphors, fantasies, freedoms, hopes and joys of airy sounds. The sounds will
    get arrested, tightly arrested in the earth.</p>
<p>And here is how it works, my copulation respiratory system, my insemination procedure with the unheard voice of the dead
    Gilad Ratman, a copulation choir of cocks penetrating the larynxes, my rhythm-voice machine, my Respiratory-Reproductive
    Contamination Unit, as I like to call it. Here is exactly how it will work and I assure you - it will work. The tremor
    of the earth under the San Andreas Fault will press the resilient liver, and then the resilient liver will boost the
    sensitive prostate, and then the sensitive prostate will push the chunks of earth into the sperm duct, and then the sperm
    duct full of marching earth crusts will shiver the hanging voice strings, and then the voice strings will change the
    rhythm of the earth stroke as it moves forwards, and then the rhythm of the stroke will be carried over and disseminated
    into the
    <em>bronchi</em>, and then from each island of the
    <em>bronchi</em>, the voice-stroke will ooze into the flutes, and then in the flutes the voice-stroke will bounce with the
    echoes of the deceased, and then the final rhythm of the trembling flute-voice-stroke will arouse the eardrum, and then
    the agitated eardrum will hand the rhythm to the shaking of the tongue, and then the shaking tongue will move the earth,
    and then the earth will shrink, and then the earth will swell, and then the earth will sound through the mouths of all
    of the deceased, and then, mouths of the deceased will speak with the dead voice of him, of Gilad Ratman.</p>
<p>Spirit walk through the walls.</p>
<p>So Marsilio Ficino said.</p>
<p>And so be it.</p>
