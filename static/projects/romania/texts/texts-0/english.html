<p><strong>LG:</strong> So there&rsquo;s five bands here?</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> And they all know each other?</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Two of them know each other and some of them have heard of each other. None of them are making money out of what they are doing. In some way it was important to me to work with people who are fuelled by their dreams. What this echoes for me is Metallica in Moscow in 1991, the most ecstatic rock concert I have ever seen, in film, of course. In some ways I am interested in this concert because of parallel histories between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Eastern Bloc, and the history of Heavy Metal. Both had climactic moments at the same time. To some degree, Heavy Metal became the soundtrack of that ultra-politically charged moment. So I wanted to revisit this. But I didn&rsquo;t want to go to Moscow - that would have been too literal.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> Heavy Metal always seems peculiarly a-political but also anti-establishment at the same time. It&rsquo;s always against some system, but you are not quite sure which system. At best, it might be against all systems somehow.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> That&rsquo;s the attitude of Heavy Metal in general I think. It&rsquo;s not even &lsquo;fuck the system&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;don&rsquo;t trust anybody&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> It&rsquo;s interesting to see the musicians functioning outside of their normal context. Like the Pink Floyd film at Pompeii. It&rsquo;s actually beautiful in a way. Your film is essentially a performance film. It&rsquo;s like a festival, but if you take the stage and the audience away you would just be standing in a field.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Daylight is important here. Also the sun and the physical exhaustion, that's something I work with a lot. It was a 48 hour thing.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> But are we really talking about exhaustion or the idea of endurance? Which is a slightly different idea.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> This is not one of those 1970's performances. It&rsquo;s not about that. It&rsquo;s about the time that might be needed for the participants to forget something they know and adapt to a new situation.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> The performers? Or the viewer?</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> The performers. Because Heavy Metal is a very iconic genre. There is a certain kind of uniform, a certain kind of behaviour which is expected. Metal is usually based on virtuosity, which cannot be maintained when your amplifier is buried in a pile under the ground with twenty other amps. Your identity is being dissolved with the others. So when you take those people into this situation you need time for them to understand that they don&rsquo;t have their usual set-up and that they need to adapt to something different, to understand that they can and they cannot trust the things that they know. For example, being exposed to direct sunlight.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> It&rsquo;s not their natural condition &ndash; although they are young enough to look good. Coming back to your earlier work this one also has a kind of paganistic feeling without knowing what it really means. Normally that is an accusation from one group to another group. I always preferred the word heretic because it is a much more political word. Someone who speaks from within a structure but who is condemned for being wrong. You burn a heretic, but pagans are beyond help. A heretic is anyone who speaks against the dominant canon, book, or current form of system. It&rsquo;s a bit like the difference between an exile and a dissident. A pagan is in exile and a heretic is a dissident. Even within the most developed religious contexts you always have those who are completely outside. I always feel that about the potential of Heavy Metal. It is always outside. It is in exile and paganistic, it is connected to earth and fire and the elements. I went to the Rock Bar in Ljubljana in the early 1990s where it was so loud and so small that you couldn&rsquo;t communicate beyond your body and your proximity to something or someone. Without being able to speak Slovenian I had the most 'free time' that I had in Slovenia. I could only signal things and gradually be within this non-space. But it was not a non-space in the traditional philosophical sense - it was an excessive place beyond normal linguistic communication.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> And this applies to all people regardless of language. In my work the distribution of energy can always be seen. In the case of <em>Five Bands, </em>everything is leading to a center, but then it comes back from the center to the margins, like a feedback system. For instance, the structure of the Pink Floyd concert in Pompeii is one band in the center trying to "set the controls to the heart of the sun". I decided to reverse this model, to speak to the center of the earth instead of the stars. Then, instead of one band I had many bands surrounding a pit. They can&rsquo;t hear themselves play since the equipment is buried in this hole. They can&rsquo;t differentiate anything, so it becomes a melting pot of everything. They have to lose something. They can&rsquo;t hear themselves in the monitors. There are no headphones or anything.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> But as with other works there is a feeling of mapping and connecting &ndash; there is some visual relation to a synapse. The performers are feeding into a synaptic system. This is not always comfortable: the mapping of the organism, the relation between sense and stuff. The work functions like an organ.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> It all started from me wanting to hear twenty amplifiers coming buried under the ground. And then you start to think &ndash; how do I do it? But the work is not a visualization of something. I wanted to experience something. Then I went further. If I try to understand what brings a new work to me, one thing is that there is always something in particular that I want to experience and the other aspect is that I want to change my relationship to earlier works.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> So you want a new experience and a shift.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Yes. Once I have finished a work it is always like a blanket that is too short. Something is always left outside. So when I start a new work it is as if I have left my leg outside. So now I have to move the blanket. Then something else escapes. I never manage to do something that is completely satisfying for me.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> But there is continuity in the work.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Yes. The things that come back are the things that I cannot explain. Psychological shit. Things that I am drawn to in ways that I don&rsquo;t fully understand. Why am I going digging? What&rsquo;s my attraction to heads or mud? The shift that I&rsquo;m looking for, in regard to previous works, is something explanatory.&nbsp; For example, after the Venice Biennale, one of my decisions was that I don&rsquo;t want to deal with a lot of people for the next project. I want to be in my studio and have a year where I am exploring something. That&rsquo;s how <em>Swarm</em> was conceived. With <em>Five Bands from Romania, </em>I was reacting to <em>588 Project</em>, which was interesting to do and to film, but ended with ten hours of footage which all felt exactly the same. So I told myself that next time I want to make a work where I look at the footage and each shot will be different. I can say that systems and mapping are also repeating in most of my works. But if you think about mapping in terms of photography, I often use a 45 degree angle when I am filming. It is very important that there is no horizon. I don&rsquo;t want an infinite horizon.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> It is interesting to think about perspective and point of view - both literally and politically.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> I don&rsquo;t understand points of view. I never use a cinematic point of view. Like when you see a close-up and then see a shot of the actor&rsquo;s point of view. In my recent work <em>Swarm </em>I have a space or model or set, all made from Styrofoam, and I have a swarm of mini-drones all exploring the space. I&rsquo;m more interested to look at them as a group than to show their point of view.&nbsp; There are also some people who seem to control the drones with remote controls, but you only see their headless naked torso through a window. They are isolated from the drones, but they suggest causality. And there is one more element: a hot wire which is cutting the structure sometimes while filming. I am thinking a lot about cutting structures. The difference between cutting a building and a terrain&hellip; What exposes more? Which cut exposes the most? I am also thinking about structural cause and effect. Many people think that I deal with stories but the work is not about that. I am playing with causality, time and space, all which appear to be connected to narrative in a way. But I see it as the relationship between these three fundamentals rather than the creation of a story.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> But some of the work does have the feeling of ancient stories which are incomplete from a modern perspective &ndash; something is always hidden.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> What makes a story enough of a story?</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> In your work there is a development that takes place in a situation but that&rsquo;s not really a story. A story is something which you get lost in. If you can&rsquo;t get lost, it is not a story, it is a situation. In your work you don&rsquo;t get lost - you get absorbed. In the work there is literal absorption. People or things get buried, covered, submerged. The sound gets absorbed.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> In cinema I am really bad with plots &ndash; who is doing what. I am drawn to other things, structural things, the relation between elements. That&rsquo;s completely satisfying to me without following the characters. Motivation is something I am not bothered with at all.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> You mean there is an idea of the actor or participant as material or as a mannequin. Robert Bresson comes close to this at some points. There is no sense of identification in your work.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> For example, what I shot two days ago are the operators &ndash; the people who operate the drones. As in much of my work you can&rsquo;t say who is controlling who and there is an intentional indifference to a point of view. If you are not using classic narrative techniques you won&rsquo;t see a point of view. But people like to assume that there is responsibility. There is always the assumption that someone is in charge, that someone is responsible. The truth is that no one is. This is the horror of the world &ndash; no one is responsible for anything.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> What about a murderer?</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Of course - but that brings us back to point of view. But in a perspective sense no one is in charge.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> There are no single people in your works. There is always a group or just a few. That&rsquo;s where mapping can occur.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> Yes. I use several manifestations of groups. A swarm or a mass moves in different ways. What I find interesting about swarming is the fact that it can apply to many things, but it is never connected through language, and rarely by retina. It is about sensing. As information, language and vision are too slow for a swarm. It always seems like an impressive ability to collaborate and to be completely unified under one will or goal. Drones can operate in this way. They can be a swarm of floating eyes. They can move by sensing and create endless points of views at the same time. But think about locusts. When times are good they don&rsquo;t act like a swarm. They only swarm when times are bad, so we assumed that they are collaborating in order to improve their situation. But then scientists discovered that when food is short, locust actually move in swarms because they are trying to eat each other and at the same time to run away from being eaten by their own friends and family. This is the &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; of their swarm behaviour.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t want the work to admire collaboration.&nbsp; I wanted to try a more complex group relationship which might be controlled by other group, and I wanted to isolate all of this in a restricted condition in order to explore this.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> Many of your works have a basis in testing logic. There is a practical side which exposes mechanisms: the creation of experience machines.</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> There are a lot of practical decisions. The choice of mud in <em>588 Project </em>was because mud is flexible enough to contain a body. So it can be an environment and a skin. If I have a worm crawling under my skin, from which perspective should we talk about identity here? The mud gave me this option. With the styrofoam in <em>Swarm,</em> what we are actually doing in the studio is building something, destroying it and building it again. Styrofoam gives me the opportunity to shuffle things continuously. It refers to isolation and it&rsquo;s a material that can contain the same information from the &ldquo;inside&rdquo; as the &ldquo;outside&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t learn anything new by cutting it, but you can understand more about the structure from which it is built. The one thing that you cannot cut is a swarm. That&rsquo;s what so scary about it. It&rsquo;s a body without a body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other side of practicality is to be able to try different options. I have to trust the fact that if I create enough material I will know, at some point, what to do with it. This is more and more the way I am working. These new works all begin without knowing what will happen in the end. I am becoming more interested in a layered relationship between works as opposed to an open field of works.</p>

<p><strong>LG:</strong> Does that approach allow you to respond to specific places?</p>

<p><strong>GR:</strong> If I cut through the building with the work, it makes a difference if I cut it one way or another. If I cut it with the work it allows the works to be isolated (by vision) and not isolated (by sound) at the same time. This is what I am trying to achieve here: an idea of stacking. I am really into this now. So if you think about cuts - there are physical cuts in the building but there are also cuts created by screens, by people in the work, and by the sound in the work. It's about going from inside to the outside without escape.</p>
